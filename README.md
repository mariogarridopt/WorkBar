=======

This is one bar made in java that will be fixed in the bottom of your screen with some stats of what you are doing.

The project was never meant to be published but since it escalated a bit from the the main idea i thought that more people may want to use it to.

##Compatibility 
This app was made in java and that allow all the OS to run it. However i build it thinking on UNIX systems, so, it will open in every operation system but the git features only work on UNIX/MAC OS X and the hidden files options only work on MAC OS X.
This app was made for MAC OS X.

##How to use
